pip freeze - to list the packages that are installed in your virtual environment.


Install a Package
To install a specific version, use == between the package name and the version number. Here's an example command:  pip install python-dateutil==1.4

Packages change over time, as previously stated. You can upgrade to the latest package without specifying what the exact version number is. Use this command:   pip install <name of package> --upgrade

Uninstall a Package
Sometimes, you might realize that you no longer need a certain Python package and you want to remove it. For such a case, you can use pip uninstall:    pip uninstall python-dateutil
