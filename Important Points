When you start learning any programming language, you first try out a few statements of code in a read-evaluate-print loop (REPL).

The idea of a program is to do something or carry out a task. To have the program do something, you'll need to add the statements or instructions to perform the task. 

A console is a command-line application that lets you interact with the operating system.

To get anywhere with coding, you need to understand that you're operating on data. As your program is working on data, you might need to remember a certain value throughout the program's execution. For that, you use variables.
